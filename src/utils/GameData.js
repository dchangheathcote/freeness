        "The most common game modes are PvP battles that revolve around a series of control points or that task players with destroying enemy vehicles, whether AI-controlled or belonging to other players. Each player brings a squad of up to five vehicles and, when your current vehicle is destroyed, you’ll choose another one to ride back into combat. You can also adjust battle realism, opting for simpler controls with target reticles and other helpful guides, or complete realism, with very few artificial elements in the way of aid. In addition to PvP battles, there are also PvE campaigns and missions you can take on alone or with other players. No matter how you play War Thunder, the action will be easy to find and the battles will have you on the edge of your seat!",

        "World of Tanks is a popular free to play multiplayer role playing team-based shooter game developed by Wargaming.net. World of Tanks is based around the middle of the 20th century, and features huge epic battles with various different game modes such as Standard, Assault, Encounter Battles, and an added bonus of 15 tanks vs 15 enemy tanks gameplay.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The game starts off with quite easy gameplay but eventuates into a more difficult game as you progress, and because a typical game only takes between 5-10 minutes the game can get quite intense as well. Unlike other games in World of Tanks you cannot respawn; so when your tank gets destroyed you tank gets destroy and you have to start a new game before you can play again. You can still watch the battlefield from a spectator but who wants to be a spectator when you can join in with action with a simple click of a button?\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "A different aspect of World of Tanks is that you wait in a queue called a “lobby” and then are launched into a random map, with random enemy players. In World of Tanks depending on your gaming style you start off with a fast lightly armored tank, a middle of the range type of tank, or a slower, more heavily armored tank. The tanks are based on real authentic tanks that were in World War 2. There are approximately 150 tanks from 3 different countries, these being Germany, Russia, and the United States of America.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The tank you choose can be customized by performing various different upgrades, which you can acquire through winning experience and credits you gain by winning battles against other enemy tanks. There are 10 different tiers, with tier 1 being a very weak tank going all the way up to tier 10 tanks which are the most powerful. Just like your tanks in the game your crew has a set of skills which progresses as you move through the different tiers in the game.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "You can own multiple tanks but can only pilot 1 tank in any one game. Depending on what nation you choose will determine what research tree you will advance through to unlock new, more powerful tanks, weapons, and crew members to help your battles against the other enemy tanks. Since World of Tanks initial release there have been numerous updates to improve the difficulty, the visual aspects, new fresh maps, and new tanks and allow more exciting clan features of the game. If you like blowing up tanks, with a quick and intense game style you will simply love this game!",

        "A free-to-play martial arts MMORPG that tasks players with learning combination attacks.",
      description:
        "Blade & Soul is a free-to-play, action combat MMORPG from NCSoft that initially released in 2012 in Korea but finally saw a Western release in January 2016. Blade & Soul is a martial arts inspired MMORPG that tasks players with learning action combat based combination attacks for each class. Currently, there are 7 classes available in the game; Assassin, Blade Master, Destroyer, Force Master, Kung-Fu Master, Summoner, and Blade Dancer. New players will want to research the classes prior to starting a new character since classes fall under various race restrictions when choosing from one of the game’s four currently available races.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Blade & Soul’s most notable feature is perhaps the game’s combat. Skills are learned as you level up and are displayed on hotbars in the traditional MMORPG style, but the actual implementation of those skills differs from most other games in the genre. While you will work with “rotations” in combat, it is perhaps better to think of these rotations in the form of “combinations” as each class will have a plethora of skills that can be combined in succession to perform very well animated combination attacks. These combinations may only be two or three buttons or they could be MUCH longer. Unlike other action combat MMOs though, Blade & Soul isn’t going to spoon   feed you the combinations by hitting one key to trigger the next strike in the combination. Instead, Blade & Soul requires you to actually learn not only the combination itself, but each ability’s timing, and the required position to execute certain parts of the combination (Your hot bar actually can change based on position. i.e. being knocked down may give you access to abilities that cannot be used while standing). Learning these combination, aiming them appropriately, and reacting to incoming attacks are the key to the game’s fast paced and sometimes complex combat. If you liked TERA’s combat, you’ll probably enjoy Blade & Soul’s quite a bit.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Leveling brings the usual grind of story, side, and repeatable quests but the game’s environments change so often and are very well rendered that you won’t get bored by the scenery for quite some time. Transportaion is handled with sprint, glide, and even water walking abilities to speed up any backtracking you may have do. Instant teleports are available by spending in-game currency. Leveling requires completion of quests and along the way players will gain gear that can be upgraded along with your character. Feed equipment that you don’t need to your sword, for example, and you get a sword that levels up as your character does. This primary upgrading mechanic applies to many different gear pieces and keeps players going after loot simply to “feed” their primary equipment.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The addition of a “Soul Shield” allows for extra stat customization provided you can find the pieces of the shield you desire. Skills can be further customized at about level 18 (it’s actually a story completion point that triggers this mechanic) by spending points in your martial tome to increase ability effectiveness.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "If you enjoy dungeons, Blade & Soul has quite a few options for you. Each dungeon (be it a full instance or just a cave on the world map) has numerous difficulty levels and varying party size requirements. This keeps the loot fest rolling as certain dungeons will drop the items needed to “Breakthrough” on your weapon and gear upgrading. The game’s matchmaking system makes finding a party for these runs very easy.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Blade & Soul’s PvP is based on two main categories; World PvP and Arena PvP. Arena PvP is a 1v1 or 3v3/6v6 (currently only in Korea) affair. Versus matches are simply queued for while World PvP is based on what your character is wearing. You read that right. World PvP is based on what you are wearing. It’s a creative way to “flag” for PvP. Simply donning the costume of one of the game’s 2 factions makes you able to be attacked by a member of the opposing faction out in the world. Other costumes could turn normally friendly NPCs into enemy NPCs that will attack you on sight.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Blade & Soul’s cash shop varies by geographic location but for the most part contains the normal consumables, costumes, and cosmetics. However, some materials are also available in the shop. The multiple shops actually utilize multiple currency types and a currency exchange system is in place to provide free players with a means to acquire cash shop items. A subscription service is also available and provides additional perks to players that opt for the payment.",

All characters have the same basic moves, but weapon drops during matches can shake things up. Each fighter has two weapons he or she can pick up, each with distinctive attacks. Some warriors specialize in close-quarters combat, while others prefer to attack at range. Characters have both heavy and light attacks at their disposal, as well as plenty of aerial acrobatics they can perform. Matches end after a time limit, or when a sufficient number of kills have been reached.\r\n" +

        "Each match in Brawlhalla can be fully customized for length, arena, and number of players. Play online with friends or with random opponents. You can compete in casual matches or take your skills to ranked 1v1 arenas by yourself or in 2v2 with a friend to climb up the ranking ladder. Matches can support up to eight players, in 4v4 team battles, or you can practice alone or against bots to master your moves.\r\n" +

        "Brawlhalla is fully free-to-play, with no hidden costs or microtransactions apart from cosmetic changes. Blue Mammoth Games even gives players the option to refund their purchase, a limited number of times, if they’re unhappy with their selection. Whether you’re a hardcore ladder-climber or a button-mashing brawler, it all adds up to one of the most enjoyable games you’ll find online!",

        "Warface is a free-to-play online FPS from Crytek, makers of the Far Cry and Crysis series of games, that utilizes the company’s proprietary CryEngine to provide first-rate graphics and a hard-hitting, fast-paced shooter experience. In the near future, a long-running global recession has brought about countless wars, and it’s up to the players to choose a side and fight for justice or for their own personal enrichment. Choose your class, choose your battleground, and prepare to engage in intense firefights that place as much value on teamwork as on individual skill with your weapon.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "There are four classes in Warface – rifleman, sniper, medic, and engineer – and all have to work together to complete the objective at hand. There are loads of options for modifying your chosen class’s primary and secondary weapons, so no two characters ever play quite the same. In combat, you’ll utilize several traditional and high-intensity moves, such as vaulting over obstacles or sliding to take out the bad guys, and any class might be called upon to help out an ally in need.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Battles in Warface take place all over the world, from the Balkans of Eastern Europe to the crowded city streets of Asia to the oil fields of the Middle East. There is a wide variety of mission types available, in both PvP and co-operative PvE. In PvP missions, players choose one of the two sides in the global war: the U.S. military splinter group Warface or the opportunistic mercenaries of Blackwood. Warface also recently introduced a new Battle Royale mode with a brand new PvP map created especially for the Battle Royale mode.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The PvE mission types run the gamut of gameplay. One type of mission, Cyber Horde, was added during Halloween 2013 and tasks players with escorting a truck through territory that’s infested with cyborg zombies. Other PvE mission types see players searching for a mech in a hostile village or playing through a series of three missions.",

        "SMITE is Hi-Rez Studio’s free-to-play MOBA title where you take on the role of an ancient god in a duel for ultimate dominance over god and man alike. With a thriving competitive scene and active support from its developer, SMITE has carved out an impressive niche in the crowded MOBA market.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Players take on the roles of mythological gods and other legendary cultural icons, such as Zeus, Isis, Kali, or Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. Gods fill the typical roles of mage, warrior, hunter, guardian, or assassin, and they can augment their abilities with items purchased during matches. Each god has a basic attack and four unique abilities, in line with their traditional powers, such as Zeus’ mastery of lightning or Sun Wukong’s transformations.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Unlike other MOBAs and their overhead view, SMITE has an over-the-shoulder, third-person look, which sets it apart visually and offers more strategic options for long-range targeting. There are multiple game modes to SMITE, but the most popular is the traditional MOBA-style five-on-five Conquest mode. In this mode, there are three lanes, protected by towers and phoenixes, with the ultimate goal of taking down the opposing team’s titan in their home base. The other areas of the map contain camps of enemies that players can defeat to earn experience and gold to level up their gods and to buy more and better items. And, of course, killing your opponents doesn’t       hurt, either.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Other game modes in SMITE include Arena, a kind of team deathmatch; Joust, a limited form of Conquest with just one lane; Assault, similar to ARAM modes in other MOBAs; and Siege, a game mode with a special juggernaut that powers through enemy defenses. Finally, SMITE is a major player in the e-sports scene, with its 2016 World Championships drawing millions of viewers and $1 million in prizes.",

        "Warframe is a 3D free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter game set in an stunning sci-fi world. In the distant future, war against the Grineer Empire leads humanity to summon ancient warriors from the distant past. Called “Tenno,” these agile fighters are equally skilled in blades and guns, able to carve their way through scores of enemies with skill and aplomb. A vast arsenal of these human weapons are called upon in mankind’s darkest hour to rescue their brethren from total annihilation.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "As one of these Tenno, staked with protecting humanity, you’ll root out the Grineer from all their hiding places, scouring the Solar System and eliminating this nefarious threat. You’ll choose from among dozens of deadly Warframes, each with its own set of skills and strengths. The game progresses through a series of levels, each themed around a planet or region of the Solar System, and each requiring a squad of four Tenno to clear. As you advance, you’ll unlock more power for your Tenno, including new weapons and skills, letting you take on even tougher enemies.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Tenno have a number of sweet moves at their disposal, including the ability to “parkour” over and around obstacles, ziplines they can balance on, wall-latching and wall-dashing, and more. Tenno are also spiritual warriors, able to channel energy to spectacular results, including augmenting their weapon damage or activating special powers. Even when downed in battle, Tenno can continue to fight and rally to continue their missions.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Between missions, you can purchase better weapons for your Tenno or even entirely new Warframes, so you can try out a different play style. Some items cost credits (in-game currency) while others require platinum, which is purchased with real money. You can also craft your own weapons and insert mods to make them more powerful. Your ship, the Liset, is also where you’ll select your next mission, which you can choose to be public, letting anyone join you, or private, which you can attempt with a pre-selected team.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Warframe requires fast reflexes and split-second timing to execute a Tenno’s most dynamic moves. Because the game demands constant progression, and the resources required to purchase those progressions, a high skill factor is required, not only to play, but to play quickly enough to advance at a reasonable rate – and to keep up with your teammates. As such, there’s a lot of repetition required. If you want to quickly rip through content over and over, growing in power with each iteration, Warframe will suit you.",

There are six classes in the game, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and players can freely swap their characters between those classes to suit their current task. The game also boasts several vehicles, ranging from tanks and armored personnel carriers to futuristic fighter jets and flying troop transports, so you never know just what you’ll be up against. You can fill a role as a driver or pilot, support your allies with healing or ammunition, or just get behind a big gun and blow people away.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Battle across the continents of Auraxis is a base-hopping affair, with each of the three factions striving to control the most territory by attacking enemy bases and defending their own. There are a number of different facilities, requiring coordination from infantry, armor, and air forces to conquer. Sometimes, efficient strategy and tactics win the day, and other times, a simple full-on direct assault will do the trick.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "As you play, you’ll earn certifications you can use to buy new weapons and passive abilities for your characters and your vehicles, or you can buy them with real money.

Building on that first game’s guiding principles, it offers a huge world to explore, populated with dynamic events that can start at any time and provide excellent variety in gameplay.

Each class has remarkable versatility, allowing it to fill a number of roles in a party and reducing the need for a full MMO-style “trinity.” Characters have limited skill bars of 10 slots; the first five are determined by your weapon and the second five by skills that you choose: a healing skill, three utility skills, and an elite skill. Different classes have ways to access other skills, and most classes have the ability to swap out weapons, so you’ll still have some variety in exactly what tools you can bring to each fight.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The heart of Guild Wars 2 is its open-world content. While there is some static content, in the form of “hearts” that you can complete once for NPCs, most of the game revolves around dynamic events, which spring up in the world at various times and often require large groups of players to complete. There are no traditional quests that require you to speak to NPCs to accept or complete them; instead, you can simply go from event to event, helping the people of Tyria as you see fit. Some events are parts of larger chains that string together and culminate in a giant event against a great threat to Tyria and require a hundred or more players to complete.",

        "Runescape, is a popular free to play 3D browser based fantasy MMORPG boasting a huge player base and a massive world with 15 years of content. Developed by Jagex, the game does not require players to choose a specific class. Subsequently, you are not limited in terms of what kind of hero you want to play. The browser MMORPG features 26 distinct skills for players to level. Players do not allocate points to upgrade certain skills. Rather, their abilities are enhanced by performing certain actions like mining ore, casting spells of fishing.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The world of Gelinor is divided into various kingdoms, regions and cities. Each regions features different loot, monsters and quests to complete. You explore this vast world via a customizable avatar. The game allows you to interact with other players in various different ways including the in-game chat system, combat and mini-games that are either competitive or collaborative.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Due to the randomized elements in the Runescape’s dungeons, gameplay remains engaging rather than repetitive. You can choose to brave the world of Gelinor alone, or collaborate with other players to take down especially challenging bosses. Should you so choose, you can also engage in PvP combat. While it does not follow a linear story, the game contains myriad quests and deep, immersive narrative to keep players engaged.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Released in 2001, the game is consistently updated to add new content, new features and various special events. The third iteration of the game, known as RuneScape 3 (RS3), is an enhanced version of the RuneScape HD update. This major upgrade was launched on Monday July 22nd 2013, bringing even more features such as a new engine, customisable interfaces and new content. But if you’re a RuneScape veteran looking for the original version, the Old School RuneScape is still available.",

Then a peek at Moonwolf Entertainment and A2 Softworks’ Temperia: Soul of Majestic might be in order. The strategy card game uses an open-handed game style where all cards are face up and combines two decks into one. The decks are made up of 20 Creature and 20 Equipment cards.\r\n" +

Mage is your obvious magical DPS – both long-range and sustained. And Cleric is mostly support but with magical melee and sustained DPS.\r\n" +

        "What if you could player roller derby, but in a more organized and less physically dangerous environment? What if it were basically Rocket League but on a track instead of a field, and wearing skates instead of driving a car. Well, if that’s what you’re looking for, Ubisoft’s latest offer, Roller Champions, is one you’ll want to check out.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "A 3v3 competitive game, Roller Champions is played in third-person. It pits two teams against each other in matches where the goal is to be the first team to accumulate 5 points. The catch is that players only have seven minutes to accomplish this task. In order to do so they’ll need to have possession of the ball and skate a lap without interferrence from the other side. If that’s accomplished players can pass the ball off to other team mates who may complete even more laps. The more laps a team completes, the more points they’ll earn when they score a goal. Be careful deciding when to hit the goal, though, everything resets if the other side manages to interrupt.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Interrupting is pretty much what you probably think it is. If a team has the ball, it’s the job of the other side to tackle them or knock them over – pretty much whatever gains them possession of the ball. That said, these things can be dodged. So just be aware of your surroundings.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "If you win matches, you’ll gain followers. More followers are accumulated every time a match is won. These allow teams to play in front of larger crowds. In addition, as with most games in this genre, players can customize their avatars’ gear. But, beyond that, they can customize their fans as well. That means players can look in the crowd and see just how many people are there for them.\r\n",

In order to win, the Drifters must move a payload to their ship at the opposite end of the map, while avoiding being destroyed by the opposing team. As one of the payloads gets closer to its destination, conflicts become more frequent as the opposing team respawns near the end. During play, players can earn accumulated loot by breaking open chests or killing roaming minions. Gathering this loot earns in-match credits that are  used to level up a Drifter. ",

As with the original game, Astellia Royal is a classic 3D MMORPG in which players rely on creatures known as Astels to help them defeat monsters and make their way in the world. Astellia Royal improves on the systems tied to Astells – particularly the AP system used to summon them.\r\n" +

        "As for the game in general, Astellia Royale sticks to the format of the original. It’s a beautiful-looking game set in a fantasy world where heroes can call upon help from the Astells. In the tradition of classic MMOs, the game provides players with both open-world and dungeon experiences, for both solo players and parties. Players can also take part in various kinds of PvP, if that’s the thing that interests them, including battles in the Coliseum, or warfare between three factions on the grand battlefield.\r\n",

        "Rhino Games Inc.’s CCG Mythgard combines cyberpunk with the heroes, gods, and creatures of the fantasy in a modern setting to create a world where magic competes against technology for control.  The competitive game features not just standard 1v1 gameplay, but also a 2v2 co-op mode and a story campaign. Gameplay is built around a unique mana-burn system that offers players the ability to burn cards in order to create mana gems of the same color as the card. Players don’t lose the card, but instead have it returned to their deck to play again at a later point. The gameboard is larger than other CCG games, offering players more options as to how they place cards in order to get the most out of them. \r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Mythgard’s also features a deep lore built into the chapter-based campaign, the card text, and even the abilities. As they play, players will discover more about the dark-fantasy dystopian world of Mythgard. This includes the varying factions inspired by real-world cultures ranging from Eastern Europe to South America. Players will encounter everything from gods to vampire lords, among other creatures.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "In addition to the general gameplay and lore, Mythgard also offers much in the way of esports elements. There’s a limited game Draft mode with PvE and PvP options, an in-game deck tracker, live spectating, and a replay system. The game also features an in-game tournament system that allows players to host or compete in tournaments ranging from friendly matches with friends to the $1k community Opens. Mythgard is available to play on PC and mobile devices with full cross-play, so players can take their game anywhere.",

        "Dreadnought is a free-to-play combat flight simulator developed by Yager Development and published by Grey Box. In Dreadnought, players pilot a massive battleship, ranging from the titular Dreadnought to the Tactical Cruiser. All ships are heavily armed with projectile weapons, and each has it’s own variety of advantages and issues. And, all ships are highly customizable — down to the smallest detail. This includes weapons and modules as well as the paint job (hull coatings and decals).\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Players take on the enemy in 5v5 class-based arena battles. With each ship having advantages and disadvantages, players will want to work together to build the most efficient team possible.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Due to the high customization options available in the game, Dreadnought only features 5 actual ships. However, players will be able to outfit them in a variety of ways, resulting in a much wider variety of ships overall.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Player matches in Dreadnought are estimated to last between 5 and 15 minutes, making it a great game for people who may not have hours to spend logged in on any given day.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "On the monetization end, Dreadnought features two kinds of currency: the currency earned in game — called “Fleet Points (FP), and the currency purchased via the game market using real cash — Grey Box Points (GP). Items bought with GP offer bonuses and customization options but will not impact gameplay.",

        "Scions of Fate is a free to play MMORPG by Netgame, and was released on November 13th, 2006. This game found major success in China and Korea, and it did so for the right reasons. Scions of Fate followed the logic that less is more. Instead of packing content after content after content into their game, they decided to make a game that was easy to pick up and play, while still having all the basic elements of a traditional MMORPG.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Scions of Fate has two different factions to choose from, which are The Order and Chaos. One interesting concept is that you are not able to choose your faction until Level 35. Most of the time a choice like that is made right from the start, so it’s interesting to be given the chance to learn more about the world before making an important decision on that caliber.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "From there, most of the other features are pretty standard, yet needed to make a proper MMORPG. There are eight different classes to choose from, Bowman, Ninja, Busker and HanBla being some of them. There is a pet mechanic built into the game, and they can be upgraded at different levels, which are 15, 50 75 and 100. With all of these easy-to-use systems along with the basic user-friendly controls, Scions of Fate is a game any new gamer looking to try a MMORPG should start with.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "One other interesting mechanic worth mentioning is their Couple system. You can experience 10 “ranks of love!” which can be used to fall in “love” with other players. If the other features of Scions of Fate didn’t sell you, maybe an extra feature like that might.",

Heroes will also gain levels in the six aspects of magic, allowing them to cast more powerful spells as the game goes on.\r\n" +

There are also instant spells that can be played during combat to alter the course of battles.\r\n" +

Creatures on the support line can’t be directly attacked, so it’s a great place to hide weak creatures with powerful abilities, so you can let your front-line creatures soak up the damage from your enemy. In addition to great cards, you’ll need plenty of tactical know-how to succeed at Spellweaver!\r\n" +

There are over a dozen heroes and hundreds of cards available, offering countless options for creating a deck.\r\n" +

A thousand years in the future, the Great Houses of humanity war on each other and on a common enemy, and their weapon of choice is 80-ton walking arsenals known as ‘mechs. Equip your ‘mech with the latest weapons and gear and take to the battlefield to turn your opponents into scrap metal!\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "After selecting your faction, your most important task as an aspiring ‘mech pilot is to choose the chassis of your ‘mech. From light scouts to heavy assault ‘mechs, each ‘mech has its own specialty and role on the battlefield. Some are better at close-quarters fighting, while other excel at long range or quick-hitting attacks, unable to sustain long-term encounters. Once you’ve chosen a ‘mech chassis, it’s time to kit it out. The weight of equipment and its power consumption are factors you must balance to ensure that your ‘mech can continue to move and fight in long battles.\r\n" +

        "There are several match types: Conquest (victory points), Assault (capture the base), Skirmish (deathmatch), and Invasion (attack/defend), which can be contested on one of over a dozen maps. In addition to one-off matches, MechWarrior Online has Faction Play, which pits the various factions against each other for control of the Inner Sphere.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "As you complete matches, you’ll earn C-bills, which you can use to buy more equipment for your ‘mech, or entirely new ‘mechs. Some equipment can only be purchased with ‘mech credits, which are awarded in smaller amounts in certain matches or bought with real money. Finally, the ‘mechs themselves earn ‘mech XP, which can be used to unlock additional capabilities and skills for the ‘mechs. There are many ways to play MechWarrior Online, so the key is finding the strategies and equipment that work the best for you.",

Take a first person shooter, add in Rules of Engagement and other Army codes, have the game developed by the U.S. Army and you’ve got America’s Army: Proving Grounds. While America’s Army is designed to be a fun game, it also serves as a bit of a recruiting tool for the U.S. Army and adds elements of Army training, core values, and a focus on teamwork to the mix.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Detailed environments and diverse maps make America’s Army a very popular free-to-play shooter. Supporting multiple games modes that include 6v6, 12v12, and other game types adds a bit of diversity between each match that keeps players engaged. Securing downed enemies adds to the feel of realism and since points are awarded for actions such a providing cover or suppression fire, America’s Army forces players to rely on the unit as a whole rather than a single player. One lone gunman is not likely to last very long against a team.\r\n" +

The dark mage uses element magic and hypnotism to attack and control opponents. She can also use her abilities to determine enemy weaknesses and enhance her own abilities. The sniper lacks defensive capabilities, but is an expert in firearms and can do massive damage to single enemies from great distances. The doctors is skilled at healing his team members and poisoning enemies.\r\n" +

In Devil Oars, multiple players gather in the Thriller Bark Mansion to battle the Devil Oars together. Should they succeed, they are handsomely rewarded.

Races can have up to 24 players, competing on tracks found throughout the world and hand-crafted with exacting detail. Cars in the game include some of the most popular sports cars in the world, including the Lamborghini Huracan and the Ferrari 458 Italia. Tracks include such famous locales as the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Nurburgring, and Watkins Glen.\r\n" +

You can compete against human opponents or against the AI, which uses Forza’s innovative Drivatar technology to deliver an experience that’s as close to competition against real people as you can get.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Though Forza Motorsport 6: Apex does have microtransactions, it will not have a VIP Pass in the same fashion as its console counterpart. Microtransactions in Apex focus on letting players avoid the most unpleasant parts of progression while not giving a competitive edge in the races themselves. The game is the first part of Microsoft’s refocusing on PC gaming, after spending over a decade concentrating on Xbox and Xbox One as the company’s primary gaming platform.",

      description:
        "Salem is a free-to-play, sandbox crafting MMORPG based on the times and trials of living in 17th Century New England. You know, a time when people were burnt at the stack for being a witch. In this version though, witchcraft and other things occult are very real and can pose quite a threat to your basic survival. And that’s what the game is mainly about: Survival. You’ll take on the role of a puritanical settler that crafts, gathers, and builds their way to a better life….well first you’ll be just trying to survive long enough to get some food, some water, and maybe a crude shelter.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "While the city of Providence is a safe zone (allowing players to meet up, trade, buy items, and not have to worry about death, everything beyond its borders is wilderness that can be fully developed by players who can alter the game’s landscape permanently. Your specific character doesn’t have a pore-define role, either. Become what you want to become by mastering a plethora of skills and trades. Build things, combat threats, or hell, even dabble in a bit of Alchemy or Goat Rearing (yes, that’s a viable skill.)\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Be careful though, outside the walls of Providence, anything goes. Since Salem features a permadeath mechanic, players will want to take their time before venturing too far. Skilling up a bit, discovering a few things you can make or build, and generally making some friends might be a huge boost to players right off the bat.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Salem’s art style is a bit unique and certainly won’t appeal to everyone. For the most part, the game adopts an isometric viewpoint similar to ARPGs like Path of Exile. The graphics themselves are quite simple and straight forward, even if they don’t tip the scales of realism in any way.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "With innumerable materials, crafting combinations, and the challenge of in-game death ever-present, Salem offers a unique contribution to the sandbox MMORPG genre. Salem is developed by Mortal Moments and published by Paradox Interactive\r\n",

        "Dirty Bomb, formerly developed under the title Extraction, is a free-to-play MMOFPS developed by Splash Damage and published by Nexon. Set in a post-apocalyptic London, Dirty Bomb boasts a “higher skill ceiling” than other free-to-play shooters in that controllers are not natively supported and no auto aim or aim assist system is used forcing players to develop faster reactions and strategies through gameplay.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Dirty Bomb’s classes work in the form of “Mercs,” mercenaries that have various skill sets that range from being able to drop turrets to calling in orbital laser strikes. Players are allowed to select multiple Mercs before a match and swap between them between deaths as needed. Currently there are three primary gameplay modes in Dirty Bomb. Objective mode challenges both team to meet various objectives on the map and the match timer has time added as each objective is met. Stopwatch mode is a variation on Objective mode except this time, each team is given a chance to both attack and then defend the objectives. The fastest time overall wins. Finally, Execution mode. This mode is straight forward: Eliminate the opposing team or blow up the objective.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Dirty Bomb’s 5 maps can support up to 8v8 gameplay and the 18 available Mercs (as of this writing) offer a fair amount of diversity, speed, abilities, and usefulness in the game. The game also features the use of a card system to augment Merc loadouts. New players will want to search out a guide for their Merc of choice as this system, while explained, does require a bit of guidance.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Dirty Bomb’s system specs are a tad higher since the game environment is nicely detailed and player reports indicate that game performance may suffer on lower end machines.",

After the last war on Earth, humanity has found a new home on the planet of Terra Sperata. But the conflicts of the past have followed the colonists across the vastness of space, and they continue to fight each other for the world’s valuable resources.

        "Your colony begins with just a few buildings, which you can arrange in any configuration you want. Later, this will become important, because strategic placement of your defenses is key to fending off attacks. You’ll start out by collecting basic resources, such as minerals and gas, which you can use to create more buildings, which will produce units you can take into combat, and you’ll receive quests from various NPCs that you can fulfill to receive rewards to help your colony grow even faster.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "In addition to regular units, you can also recruit heroes, individual characters with special abilities that you acquire in a number of different ways. Once you’re ready, you can embark on a series of missions where you send out your units and heroes to explore Terra Sperata to confront aliens and pirates. If you’re up for an even greater challenge, you can attack your fellow colonists, plundering their resources to use for your own.\r\n" +

        "Transformice is a cute little free-to-play massively multiplayer platformer from French developer Atelier 801 that puts you and a bunch of your closest friends – or maybe enemies – on a quest for cheese. Each level consists of a piece of cheese and a hole to serve as a start and end point. Players have two minutes to get to the cheese and get back to the hole, jockeying for position with other mice along the way. In addition to pits, ledges, and other difficult-to-reach places, some levels include elements with physics-based properties, such as bridges that wobble and snap if too many mice are on it.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "One mouse on each level is the shaman, who has mystical powers that allow him to place elements in the world to (theoretically) help all mice reach the cheese. He can bridge gaps or build ramps to help, and the more mice who reach the cheese on his watch, the faster he progresses up the shaman skill tree to learn even more impressive talents. But a poor shaman can also just get in the way, “accidentally” blocking off areas and leading mice to their doom.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "With seven game modes, hundreds of official maps, and millions of player-created maps, no two rounds of Transformice are ever exactly the same. The cash shop consists of only one type of item – hats – which have no gameplay benefits and can be earned in-game, though be warned: Some are incredibly difficult to obtain!\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "There’s even an adorable cartoon show based on the game that you can view on the website or via the Transformice YouTube channel. In the end, don’t be be fooled by Transformice’s cutesy graphics and theme – as one player puts it, it’s not a kids’ game, but a game you win with “the blood of the other mice you need to trample over to get the cheese and get to the goal to see your wife and family.”",

There are even takes on the classic Counter-Strike maps and scenarios, such as Bomb Defusal and Hostage Rescue.\r\n" +

With the Family system, you can share your gear with your friends, especially handy if they’re low on shotguns.\r\n" +

Zombies can increase their passive abilities, such as speed or enhanced jumping capabilities, as well as learn special attacks to carve through those squishy humans.\r\n" +

Players start on one of two continents: Nuia, home of the elves or Harihara, home of the Ferres. After that, the choices are up to the player from where to go, to why, and what actions to perform.\r\n" +

Labor points are gained based on time spent in game (unless you are a premium member) and accumulate over time. There are 7 different levels of mastery for each profession and each level grants a crafting benefit of some sort to the player.\r\n" +

        "ArcheAge features both PvE and PvP options. PvE choices include the typical dungeons and quests, while PvP offers features such as the Justice System, Arenas, Naval Battles and World PvP. Community options go beyond what is typical for an MMORPG, and while guilds are a part of the community, there are also factions and families.

The land is brimming with nights and barbarians in this sequel to the online city-building strategy game Tribal Wars. The goal is to expand your kingdom and defend it from enemy players in this real-time PvP-driven world. Players can progress through the game in various different fashions depending on what units they decide to recruit. To conquer the world, players can exercise diplomacy and forge alliances to defend themselves against opponents, or break alliances and defeat other players in battle.\r\n" +

The MMORTS game allows players to engage in strategic battles, requiring them to choose the proper units for the situation, defend from attacks and launch counter-attacks. You can also recruit spies to analyze your enemy’s defenses. Other players can do the same, however, so be sure to strategically launch countermeasures to ensure you are prepared for anything.",

        "\r\n" +
        "Robots in Robocraft are made of cubes, which you gain access to by leveling up your robot. The more cubes your robot has, the higher its robot ranking, and the higher its robot ranking, the more rewards you get in battle that you can use to buy even more cubes. There are over 200 cubes and other components you can acquire to beef up your robot, and the options for building them are nearly limitless. Your robots can drive, walk, or fly, and bristle with weapons, from SMGs to railguns to plasma launchers.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Once your robot is kitted out and ready for a fight, take it into one of Robocraft’s multiplayer modes, such as the battle arena, where each team is tasked with taking out its opponent’s protonium reactor while protecting their own. Towers on the map can be captured and used to strike at your opponents, giving this game mode a very MOBA-like feel. For something a little simpler, try your basic team deathmatch, where the object is to wipe out all of your opponents or capture their base, or the Pit, a free-for-all battle with respawns, where the object is to reach a set number of kills. You can also practice your skills against a test robot or in single-player mode.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "More cubes, weapons, and game modes are always in development, and its flexible building system means there’s virtually no limit as to what you can do in Robocraft. Take your robot-building skills to the limit and see how long you can survive!",

        "Unturned is an independently developed free-to-play massively multiplayer survival game that borrows inspiration from similar, bigger-budget, titles but has its own unique charm and is one of the best gaming values to be found anywhere on the Internet. You’ll fight for your life against zombies and other players, trying to survive against impossible odds in a post-apocalyptic landscape.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "When you start a new character in Unturned, you’ll be dropped off in a random location on the map, with little in the way of supplies to keep you alive. You’ll have to hunt and scavenge for clothes, weapons, food, and drink. Supplies can be further refined into new materials using the game’s extensive crafting system and can even build permanent bases to fortify themselves against both zombie and human enemies. There are also vehicles to be found, which can be used to get around or to act as an additional weapon to flatten your foes. As they harvest items and kill NPCs, characters gain skill points they can use to increase their offensive, defensive, and miscellaneous/support capabilities.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Unturned has four difficulty levels, set by the server owner. Easy mode is for players new to survival games and has greater loot drops. Normal mode is the standard. Hardcore mode makes several game elements more difficult and removes most UI elements for a more “natural” experience. Finally, there’s Gold mode, available only to Gold subscribers, with vastly increased loot spawns and XP gains. Also If you’re after a battle royale game then seek out Unturned: Arena Mode\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Unturned was developed by 16-year-old Nelson Sexton, who cut his designing teeth by creating popular levels for Roblox. Despite its humble origins and simple artistic design, Unturned has been downloaded on Steam by nearly 20 million players as of the start of 2016 and Sexton continues to update the game on a regular basis, with his only compensation being inexpensive Gold packs that allow for premium servers and greater character customization.",

Decks contain 30 cards, with no more than two of any individual cards or one legendary card.

There’s also the Arena, where players pay a fee to enter and build their decks from a random assortment of cards. They are then matched up against other Arena players until they take three losses or win 12 games. The farther a player progresses in the Arena, the greater his rewards. There are also Tavern Brawls, which features specialized rules or random decks, which rotate out on a weekly basis.

        "Trion Worlds’ flagship fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game.",
      description:
        "Rift is a solid 3D fantasy free-to-play massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Trion Worlds’ flagship MMORPG, Rift, started as a subscription based MMORPG and later made a free-to-play conversion in June of 2013. MMORPG players probably remember Rift’s aggressive advertising campaign leading up to its 2011 release. This campaign specifically touted Telara, the game’s world, as the new place for players to be and poked fun at chief rival World of Warcraft with slogans like “You’re not in Azeroth anymore” in most print and media advertisements.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Character creation in Rift allows players to choose their race (limited by faction) and a starting archetype (calling) for your playstyle. The five callings currently available are Primalist, Warrior, Mage, Cleric, and Rogue. Players have ample room for customizations inside these callings though as each calling has a multitude of “souls” (what would be more traditionally referred to as “classes”) that allow players to mix and match abilities within each calling to customize their character’s abilities. This mixing and matching of multiple souls allows hundreds of playstyle combinations, some more viable than others. Some souls are only available through purchases of cash shop packages.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Rift features two faction gameplay between The Defiant and The Guardians, although updates since launch have blurred the lines between factions by allowing factions to group together, chat, and even guild together. Factions still play a role in Rift’s PvP Warfronts. This PvP content features multiple maps and gameplay types that focus on point accumulation or point capturing. Open world PvP is also supported provided you are playing on a PvP server.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Players looking for PvE content will find that Rift offers a vast world to explore, dungeons (solo, duo and party varieties), raids, in world events such as the “Rifts” for which the game is named, and an extensive storyline detailing the elemental planes and how they interconnect and impact the world of Telara. “Instant Adventures” allow players to group quickly, and level rather quickly, through quick bursts of open world content. Traditional questing is also a leveling option.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Numerous subsystems provide Rift players with ample activities in which to partake. Player housing is accomplished through a “Dimensions” system that allows players to unlock multiple area types and decorate them as they see fit. This system has been expanded to also allow players to create their own PvP Dimensions and bring their own PvP maps to life. The Minion mini-game, crafting, collectibles, and achievement hunting are big parts of the Rift community and numerous sites cater to each of these items alone.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "While equipment is available in Rift’s cash shop, this equipment is “one off or worse” than the current best equipment available in the game. To achieve the best gear, players will have to play the game and cannot buy their way to max power. Most of this gear is also available through in game currency gathering as well. The cash shop is designed in a “time versus money” approach with players being able to spend either the in game time or the cash to advance quickly, but either method ends with players having to play to achieve the best in slot items. Patron (subscription) status is available for those that want to earn Loyalty points (a cash shop “rewards” program) and receive monthly perks allowing for more rapid character advancement. Players wishing to buy cash shop items without spending real world money have the option of purchasing “REX” in game from other players. REX can be used to obtain credits that can be spent in the cash shop.\r\n" +

Characters advance through Path of Exiles enormous skill tree, which allows players to select new passive and active abilities as they level up. Gear is similarly flexible, with high-end equipment having slots that can equip gems that provide various bonus effects. In total, there are countless ways to build and equip characters, so that no two will ever be the same.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Path of Exile has a traditional MMO experience, where players can progress through various zones, level up, and gain gear, but there are several other ways to play as well. The most popular is races, where players start with brand new characters and compete to acquire the most experience or achieve other goals over a set period of time, which can range anywhere from a few minutes to a month. Each race season features a number of events, usually numbering over a hundred, and sometimes include race modifiers to make things more challenging.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Finally, Path of Exile has a true commitment to free-to-play, with a relatively small cash shop and no items that grant advantage. It’s become a favorite of many hardcore gamers for its diverse option and challenging content, but it can be enjoyed by a wide range of players of all skill levels.",

The space between lanes, the “jungle,” is occupied by neutral enemies that either team can kill to obtain bonuses. The object of the game is to push through the opponents’ defenses all the way to their base, where their Ancient resides, and destroy it.\r\n" +

        "Panzar is a free-to-play, team-based, fantasy multiplayer third-person shooter with rpg elements, non-target combat and CryEngine 3 powered graphics. Players choose from different 8 classes, these being Tank, Inquisitor, Paladin, Berserker, Sorceress, Witch, Gunner, and Sapper. The classes are best suited to different styles of gameplay, for example the Paladin performs best as a support, where as the Berserker is ideal for full on melee combat.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The game includes a total of 4 very different game types with dynamic Team-Based PvP and PvE, including maps for each game type. Game types include Domination, King of the Hill, Siege, and Meteor. In a game of Domination players must attack opposing forces for a point of interest, in King of the Hill, players must hold a landmark, and defend making sure that the enemy does not gain control, Siege, is where players need to attack multiple objectives, and the enemy team needs to defend, and lastly the Meteor game type, where the player needs to look for an objective element, and return it to the players base.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Unlike games such as League of Legends which uses an isometric perspective, the player is controlled using a third person view. The landscape is remarkable incredible from snowy and cold environments, to volcanoes. Which are all rendered with the lovely CryEngine 3 game engine. The maps are handled nicely since when you start a new game the map will be chosen randomly.  A unique aspect for each map are the secrets in the map which a player can use to change the map for the players advantage.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Attacking enemy players in Panzar is based on a free-targeting type of game. Damaging enemy players is entirely based on the angle of attack. The controls for the game use the mouse in order to strike attacks. The left mouse button is used for auto-attacks, and the right mouse button is used for massive power attacks which drains your power. Power in the game is indicated by a power bar, which can be restored using abilities to the player, or by just simply waiting for the power bar to fill. Magic in the game including abilities use mana, and a points called action points. Action points in the game are earned through killing enemy players. To block in the game players need to press the control key.",

        "A free-to-play martial arts action MMORPG with a large open world and sandbox-like features.",
      description:
        "Age of Wushu by Snail Games (“Age of Wulin by Webzen” in other global regions) is a free-to-play Wuxia inspired MMORPG that focuses on delivering a large open world while offering sandbox-like features. New players will take the role of an aspiring martial arts expert and will choose one of 8 schools. The school you choose will alter what skills your character will learn (and become more proficient at) over time and learning these skill “books” is the game’s primary advancement technique as Age of Wushu eschews the traditional “leveling” mechanics found in other MMOs. Your chosen school also determines the weapon type your character will use.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Age of Wushu has been developed using a proprietary engine called “FLEXI.” This engine allows the game to maintain a higher graphical performance and makes updates to technology easier to implement in game by simply adding new modules to the engine rather than upgrading the entire engine itself.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Combat in Age of Wushu is a bit different than other MMORPGs. Combat takes on a more “rock-paper-scissors” mentality. Skills are categorized as “Overt” damage skills, “Feint” defense-breaking skills, and “Block” defensive skills. There are secondary “Chi” (energy) draining skills outside of these three categories but combat primarily revolves around using the right skill type at the right type to react to PvE and PvP threats. Movement skills, including gliding, jumping, and water walking, make the game’s combat reminiscent of martial arts movie action scenes.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "While Age of Wushu features traditional MMORPG features like questing, PvP, an in game marketplace, and a story that’s been expanded through multiple game expansions, the game is maybe most well-known for some of its more unique features. The “Offline Mode” allows players to advance their characters in some ways while not actually playing the game. Assigning your character duties in shops, school, or other locations while you are offline can net your character benefits when you return to the game. The other side of that feature, though, allows players in game to kidnap offline players for gains of their own. In game, players can also use systems like the “Criminal System” to place bounties on other players.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Age of Wushu brings some unique items to the MMO game space but may not be a hit with all players. It is certainly a game that benefits from playing for free for a bit prior to spending money on something that may not be your “cup of tea.”",

Initially released in Korea in 2004, Mabinogi is loosely based on Irish mythology and sports a very unique anime art style that uses hand drawn images and sharp image outlining. While the game is an MMORPG and has features like dungeons, quests, and leveling, the game is now more well known for its social and fashion aspects.\r\n" +

        "With the ability to do almost anything you want to do in game (literally, you can write music if you want to), Mabinogi allows players to truly play the game they want to play… even if that game involves consuming the thousands of fashion items added to the game. While each update has added to the game’s main story threads, players are free to explore and live their own personal fantasy life if they wish… the RPG elements of the game aren’t even required in some cases.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "For those looking to take on quests, monsters, dungeons, and other traditional MMO content, fret not as Mabinogi offers plenty of that as well. PvP and duels are available in special areas of the game’s vast and beautiful world.\r\n" +

Additionally, flotsam (pieces from a shipwreck) can be collected from around the shores of players’ islands, which can contain every available resource in the game. This serves as a nice means of burning time while players wait to finish researching technologies or completing new structures.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "From the world map, players can see shipwrecks to salvage and other islands to pillage. Some will make for easy prey, but landlubbers beware: some will be defended by captains from neighboring islands. Troops, which are needed to attack other players, can be obtained from the tavern once it’s built. Players with the necessary resource like gold and rum can deploy their pirate fleet comprising both offensive and defensive troops. They each serve a distinct purpose, and certain missions will call for one or the other.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Once a player has attacked another player, they will appear on each other’s “enemy list.” Players can attack people on their list as much as they please, provided they have the resources. Players can also attack certain points held by other players such as stashes of gems or gold. Each point has an expiration date that ticks ever closer while it is occupied. Additionally, if a player is part of an alliance, they can deploy troops to protect points held by their friends to ensure it is not successfully plundered before the timer runs out. Players can research defensive technologies and build certain structures like walls to protect their strongholds from enemy attacks.",

        "Stronghold Kingdoms is a strategy based building/warfare game developed by Firefly Studios and based on the long running Strongholds PC game series. Players will be tasked with building their own settlement and watching it flourish. This settlement advancement follows paths similar to other Strongholds titles in that players will research advancement paths of their choosing to open up new build options and new technologies.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Stronghold Kingdoms adds in a card mechanic that allows players to use cards as modifiers when building, trading, and attacking or defending their own Stronghold. As in previous titles though, diplomacy is a key aspect of success in Strongholds Kingdoms. Trading, negotiating, and working with thousands of other players through the game’s world is the key to taking over land and working your way up to a leadership role. Be careful though as working against the wrong alliance could spell the end to all of your hard work very quickly.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Stronghold Kingdoms gathered early praise when it launched in 2012, but recent player reviews lean more towards the game becoming more pay to win than most players would like. With well-established alliances in game already, starting out can be hard for new players looking to try out the game for a bit prior to spending real life money. A certain amount of “join us or die” mentality seems to pervade player reviews and new players may log in to find everything they’ve been working for gone rather quickly.\r\n" +

        "Star Wars: The Old Republic is a 3D sci-fi MMORPG based on the popular Star Wars universe and brought to you by Bioware. Star Wars: The Old Republic allows players to become one of several different iconic classes including Jedi, Sith, and Troopers, with a variety of species to choose from. Each class follows their own unique custom storyline which contains a number of dynamic questions allowing players to become immersed in their character’s progression and ultimately choose their own destiny.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Players choose to join either the Galactic Republic or the Sith Empire. The game is set more than 3,500 years prior to the films and allows players to visit and interact with some classic environments such as the planets Tatooine and Coruscant. While each class may favor a certain playstyle (tank, DPS, or healer) customization options along with companion characters allow the individual player to adapt to a number of situations without relying on the support of other players. Character appearance customization is limited to a few slide bar choices but further options are available through the cash shop with the use of Cartel Coins.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Character leveling and progression is done through the standard missions, exploration, and defeating enemies. New skills are learned at each level and are taught by trainers in a number of locations. There are heroic missions that require the cooperation of other players and can typically be repeated on a daily basis. Leveling has been vastly accelerated to encourage players to jump into the game’s more recent expansions.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "One of the more unique features about Star Wars: The Old Republic is that the dynamic choices players make can permanently open or close parts of the story line and can affect the player’s NPC companions and any relationships you may have with those companions.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Crafting in Star Wars: The Old Republic is a much more passive activity than the typical MMORPG, NPC companions carry out the gathering and crafting activates as assigned by the player while the player is participating in active adventures. A player can assign up to 5 companions to perform 3 different skills.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Star Wars: The Old Republic has taken some heat for a somewhat restrictive cash shop. In fact, some of the features mentioned above may be hidden behind a “cash wall” The game does still offer a subscription for players who prefer that experience.",

Players can participate in one-on-one dance battles or team up with others. While dancing, players must strike certain keys to progress through the dancing sequence to unlock more advanced moves and combos. The dance halls in 5Street feature selections of music based on top music charts from around the world and feedback from players. The game was developed by Snail Games has a large fan base in China and a growing presence in the U.S. and Europe.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The customization aspect is a major draw of the game, as players can don thousands of different outfits available in the in-game stores. However, certain outfits cost real money—rather than in-game currency. Players can also attain various, unique in-game pets. Additionally, every 5Street player own a virtual home for storing extra items. Unfortunately, these homes offer little in the way of customization.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The game is visually appealing, boasting decent graphics and realistic dance moves. However, the social aspect of the game is what sets it apart from otherwise similar dancing MMOs. Players’ interactive options do not stop at dancing. For example, they can communicate with each other via emotes ranging from punching to kissing. 5Street also features a romantic element that allows players to participate in couples dancing and even marriage. Additionally, players can video-chat with each other in the designated video-chat dance halls.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "5Street keeps players coming back by offering quests and achievements, and publicly-displayed leaderboards featuring the highest-ranking players. While the amount of songs available is nothing special compared to other online rhythm games like Audition Online, the ample opportunity for avatar customization and social element makes 5Street a unique, entertaining dancing MMO.",

        "In Dragon Nest, players select from a number of pre-created heroes that have various skill sets (specializing in magic, ranged, melee, etc) and play through a series of instance based “dungeons” to level, learn new skills, and gain fame and fortune. What the game lacks in character creation options (you really only customize color and clothing) the game makes up for in its more action and arcade style combat. Players will be challenged in combat (you can adjust difficulty) and will require lightning fast reactions and intelligent use of skill combinations to take down their foes…even other players. This makes combat (and PvP) more of a skill based encounter where skill can trump character level.\r\n" +

The game’s cash shop also garners some criticism with the offering of special in game items in addition to the standard costume/pet fare.

      description:
        "DC Universe Online (DCUO) is a free-to-play, comics based MMORPG developed by Daybreak Game Company (formerly Sony Online Entertainment.) Start your adventure by creating your very own superhero or villain, complete with various superpowers, and then team up with iconic DC Comic characters like Batman, The Joker, and others to complete your “training” as a new resident of this hero infested world.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "While DCUO sports many traditional MMORPG systems, the game also has a more unique interface specifically designed for an MMO that spans both PC and console platforms, and one that lends itself very well to controller play.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "PvE content is explored primarily through the use of story episodes, raids, Duo instances, and Iconic Battles. Following the game’s DLC story additions, DCUO allows players to fly, sprint, and brawl their way through memorable locations such as Gotham City, Metropolis, and others all while assisting well known DC Universe characters throughout the DLC story. DCUO is a free-to-play title, but additional DLC does come at a cost for those that do not opt for the monthly subscription fee. These additional content items (episodes) can be purchased individually as can additional character slots and other in-game items.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "On the PvP side of content, DCUO provides two primary PvP options: Arenas and Legends. Matches come in the 1v1, 2v2, 4v4, 5v5, and 8v8 variety. Legends PvP allows players to assume the role of pre-balanced iconic DC characters regardless of the player’s actual character level or faction affiliation. This mode is a nice way for players to farm PvP currency without having to wait until they level but some heroes and villains are locked and require either a cash purchase or unlocking with PvP currency. Arenas are the more standard PvP option allowing players to take their individual characters into the fray. Open world PvP is available provided that the player has entered a PvP server.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "DCUO is available on PC and the Playstation 4 and Playstation 3 gaming consoles.",

        "Bloodline Champions is a free to play 3D MOBA-like game published by Funcom. Participate in multiple game modes that are fast paced and can be played solo or with a team. It varies from other MOBAs by making it more of a skill-focused game instead of grinding for gold and items.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Join in the matchmaking system where you can play quick rounds that last 2-3 minutes each. The matchmaking system supports both solo and team play and has brackets for 2v2s and 3v3s. There are multiple game modes that you can participate in: Arena, a deathmatch style game mode where players kill each other over and over again for points and the team with the most points wins, Capture the Artifact, run to your opponent’s base and pick up their artifact and then run it back to your base without getting killed to score points, and Conquest, control various areas on the map for points and the team with the most points at the end of the match wins.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Instead of grinding out gear like you normally would in a MOBA by killing creeps, gathering gold, and purchasing items, Bloodline Champions makes the genre more skill based. There are no critical hits or passive buffs that your characters can receive and all of your attacks need to be manually aimed, there’s no auto-lock here. Take control of one of the various types of bloodlines each with their own unique weapons and battle your opponents in an easy to learn, hard to master style of game.\r\n" +

        "The world of Dragon Saga is a land where dragons roam the land and heavens, and where a civilization brimming with extraordinary magical powers also exists. Since the end of the Dragon War, dragons and humans have lived in peace, albeit on separate worlds ­ humans in their homeland, and dragons exiled to the depths of Aether. But the peace was not to last, for the Dark Dragon Elga would lead a revolt that would bring the death of the Dragon Lord and an invasion of dragons to the human world. That was one thousand years ago; the Five Heroes defeated Elga in battle and imprisoned him in the labyrinth of the Shadow Cabinet. But the victory brought about by the Five Heroes doesn’t last. One of them, Paris, promised Elga freedom in exchange for immortality and beauty, she then launched an attack against her old allies ­ and looked to Elga to form an alliance. The only question that remains is: will peace ever return to the world of Dragon Saga?\r\n" +

Dragon Saga also allows you to take care of and love a large variety of pets, that will also give you in-­game buffs, and sometimes even a ride.

        "Vindictus is a free to play action MMO game (MORPG) by Nexon, the same people who brought you Mabinogi. This prequel to Mabinogi takes place several hundred years before the story of Mabinogi. In Korea, the game is known as Mabinogi Heroes, though the name was changed for North American and European audiences.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "In the beginning of Vindictus, humans are convinced that if they can destroy Fomors, or monstrous humanoids, they will essentially be taken into their version of Heaven, known as Erinn. Players battle through hordes of enemies either alone, with friends, or sometimes with strangers, to take out these creatures. Vindictus is broken up into “Seasons” and with each season, the story changes and brings a whole new level of exploration and understanding.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The game centers around an intense combat style that teaches you to avoid getting hit or die. Fighting Combos are also valued far more than a general face-roll concept many MMOs have found themselves taking on. The ten classes of the game are all gender-locked, as you are portraying a particular character rather than just a class, but some customization of the characters is allowed, including coloring or cutting their hair. The dungeons have dynamic difficulty with the health of the bosses scaling to the number of people in the party.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Vindictus holds true to Nexon’s business model and is free to download and play, while offering a “Cash Shop” for those willing to drop some money on the game. Filled with magicians, warriors, archers and thieves of all varieties, your choices will depend on your personal fighting preferences and your desired role within the game. All classes are intended to deal damage and be self-sufficient as they battle through a real-time combat system. The world has several cities that act as hubs for people to form parties with instanced mission stages where quest objectives are completed. For those seeking beautiful graphics and an intense battle-style, Vindictus may be just the ticket.",

This is a unique old-school PvP/PvE sandbox that just requires a little creative energy and the craving for opportunity. You will be able to choose your character’s race and profession, as well as choose your own play style and where you want to place your loyalties in the game…that is, if you have any!\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Mortal Online is not for the faint of heart. With “full loot” mechanics, dying means that you risk losing everything you’re carrying with you. Danger is everywhere and safety must be earned. You will need to learn how to master real time, aim based combat where you will decide every move your character makes ­ this where your skills really matter.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "In Mortal Online, you will choose your character from among many races, and will choose your character’s profession ­ combat, crafting, magic, trading, etc. You will be able to discover a countless amount of skills along the way, gather resources and tools, master a few or dabble in them all, and even have the chance to be the first to explore a new area of the map to find hidden treasures and unique secrets before anyone else!\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Mortal Online offers a free to play mode with a skill cap at skill level 60. In order to unlock the maximum skill levels and fully master your Mortal destiny, a paid monthly subscription is needed, but unlike many other games there are no microtransactions. Unsubscribing will re­apply the skill cap, but your skills will be maxed again when you re­subscribe. Every player will get one free character slot, but you can purchase additional slots up to a maximum of four.",

        "Did you seriously come to this page to get a description of what League of Legends was? Oh well… if you showed up here I should at least give you the basics. League of Legends is a free-to-play competitive MOBA game, and one of the most played video game in the world, developed by Riot Games.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Players are tasked with teaming up with other players and squaring off against another team of players, typically in 5v5 matches. Three lanes connect a team’s base (or Nexus) to the other team’s base. Defensive measures for both teams also reside in each lane. Players choose a hero from over 120 Champions. Each character has its own skill set and abilities that help it excel in certain areas of the game. The key to winning matches is teamwork and solid reactions to enemy abilities. A strong understanding of the item meta game and what helps each particular champion is certainly desirable.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Push each lane and try to take out your opponent’s defensive turrets (and their ever spawning creeps – small NPC minions that blindly move forward on each lane) and enemy champions on your way to taking out the enemy Nexus and scoring yourself a win.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Along the way, your champion will gain experience and gold and level up their abilities and allow you to purchase game items to modify your champion’s stats and performance.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "These battles take place in two different game modes across a total of 4 available maps…although you’re probably only going to ever see one map unless you play in games against AI bot opponents.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "In addition to in-game leveling and ranked matches each season, players also have modifiers on their profile through the use of Rune Pages. These pages allow players to “socket” Glyphs, Marks, Seals, and Quintessences to modify stats for you as the player. These modifications are then placed on any Champion you choose to play.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Matchmaking in League of Legends is based primarily on your skill and past match performances. The automated system attempts to match competitors up with players of a similar skill level so as to avoid blowout matches.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "League of Legends is often held up as the quintessential free-to-play model in that no aspect of gameplay (besides arguably additional rune pages even though they are not essential) is locked behind a cash shop purchase. The cash shop houses skins, cosmetics, and Champions and currency to purchase these items can be bought with real world money or farmed in-game.",

        "Might & Magic Hereos Online is a free-to-play multiplayer online PC game created by Blue Byte. The game starts off in the vast environment of Ashan, and allows the player to take control of a town, battle opposing units with a recruited army. The game starts when players can choose from one of two factions. Either the evil Necropolis or the good Haven faction both factions offer different types of heroes, abilities, and different unit types. After choosing the faction the player will then need to choose the class for their hereo, ranging from one Might Hereo which typically is a Knight class, or one Magic Hereo this being a Cleric class. The process continues as each Heroe has their own combat styles, and abilities so the hereo needs to be choosen wisely. Characters have very little customization, and only having the choice of male or female, three different robe colors, and three different portraits. After character creation players will be launched into the ability tree.  As the player progress throughout the game by leveling up, leveling up awards the player awarded with points to spend on the six ability trees. The trees are split into different tiers, and need different requirements in order to achieve them. For example in order to get into the second tier the player needs a minimum of three points. Once the player has spent their points on the ability tree the player will then be able to launch the game. The graphics in the game are 2d, and the player controls the game with a mouse. There are some hot keys for the game, but not too many.  The game begins with a giant griffin guardian protecting the main gate. The players only option is to attack the griffin, and so the action begins. Once battle begins it starts off like a Final Fantasy battlefield with different hexes for different landscape options. Players have to use strategy to strategically make sure that their troops are in the right position for the best advantage point against the opposing forces. Players also have the awesome ability of using heroes with special powers to combat the enemy units too. The battle will continue until all enemy units have been killed, and once killed the player will be awarded with XP, also ingame currency on occasion. The battle scene will disappear and the player will be presented with the top-down isometric main game again.",

        "Runes of Magic is a free-to-play fantasy 3D MMORPG brought to you by Runewalker Entertainment. Set in the fantasy world of Taborea, Runes of Magic allows players to choose between three races and ten different classes with an additional multiple class system. Both the races and classes are relatively standard for an MMORPG and determine the players starting area although there is the ability to customize class skills.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Character creation allows for some appearance customization such as choice of hairstyle and the standard modification sliding bars. Most of the customization comes from choosing a class based on its unique skill set and once the player has reached level 10 the ability to choose a secondary class is available. Combining the skill sets creates 60 different possibilities and can adapt the game to fit each player’s own play style. Choosing this secondary class gives a stat boost to the main class, an additional set of sub abilities to add to the main set, and different combinations can unlock elite skills at specific levels. Each class must be leveled separately and the secondary class is always capped at the level of the main class.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Runes of Magic features over 4,000 quests for adventurers to complete, a series of epic quests, over 20 instances and raids, and a unique crafting system. The crafting system features 9 professions to choose from based on what you feel your character can use to benefit them the most. There is also an extensive pet and mount system, a housing system, and several different PvP modes.",

This game features one of the most in-depth character customizations in any free-to-play MMO.\r\n" +

One feature that sets this mount system apart from the rest is that flying mounts can be made combat ready thus changing the dynamics of play particularly in the PvP area.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Character advancement can be achieved in a variety of ways including questing, teaming up with other players for instances and bosses in the open world, as well as through PvP. Unique events occur on a regular basis and include treasure hunts and horse races among others. Players can join a guild and thus join in a creative PvP experience called Territory Wars. Each guild will vie for control of a territory which can them be threatened by another guild in an epic 80 vs. 80 PvP battle for control of that region. These territory wars are held weekly and have a three-hour time limit attached to them.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Crafting in Perfect World International consists of four trades which become available at level 5. The Apothecary trade allows for creation of remedies and charms, the Blacksmith creates weapons, the Tailor creates armor, and the Jeweler creates accessories. Crafting in this game also awards leveling experience so although time is certainly required to level your craft your, character progression continues at the same time.",

        "Shaiya is a free to play MMORPG created by Aeria Games and was released on December 24th, 2007. The Dragons, Nordeins and Dumianas were created by the Goddess Etain. Due to Etain’s opinion of the Nordeins, she casted them into the earth. The Dumianas decided to kill Etain due to questioning her power. Due to this, Etain’s soul was torn in half, leaving Teos vulnerable and unbalanced. This allowed other Gods to take over Teos, and other races joined the mix, adding to the conflict and war of Teos.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "You can take up arms in either the Union of Fury or the Alliance of Light, with the end goal of controlling Teos for your faction, while desperately seeking the blessing of Etain. Shaiya is a MMORPG that takes a lot of its gameplay stylings from the popular title World of Warcraft. You can choose between four playable races in Shaiya, with 12 unique classes. Each race has three of the 12 classes available to them. Gaining the blessing of Etain is a huge part of Shaiya, and is determined by the Blessing of the Goddess system. There are PVP modes available in Shaiya, including large scale battles which are always a blast in any MMO.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Another key feature in Shaiya is the “Ultimate” mode. If you have ever played Diablo, you are familiar with the Permadeath system, which is what the “Ultimate” mode is based off of. If you are willing to risk your character at every corner, then this mode is for you, since the bounty from trying this mode is completely worth it. Download Shaiya today and gain the Blessing of Etain!",

        "\r\n" +
        "The game boasts 15 different playable classes, not all of which are combat focused. The classes that focus on combat are the Assassin, Priest, Summoner, Wizard, Magician, Protector, Warrior, Swordsman, Spearman, and Archer. The classes that are not combat focused are the Weapon Craftsman, Armor Craftsman, Tailor, Technician and the Chef. These different types of classes allow players to either go out into the world and fight monsters for a living or go out there and gather resources to create things in an attempt to control the economy.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "There are the normal PvE questing and dungeons that you will find in any MMORPG out there, but if you get tired of that while you are playing Angels Online and want to relax a bit you can always collect the different mounts and pets or even play a mini-game or two for fun and reward.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "While the game does not focus on the PvP side of things it does include it for people that would like to participate. You can choose to fight in either the Angel Arena, the Holy Battlefield, or participate in a Totem Battle. Each of these different PvP modes offer different rewards some of them to benefit you personally and others to benefit your guild.\r\n" +

        "Seal Online is a MMORPG by Playwith Interactive and was released in July 16th, 2003. When looking for a new MMO to play, many gamers have criteria that every game needs to hit before they even consider the title. If part of your criteria is an MMO that has been out for a long period of time with solid history under its belt, then Seal Online will come onto your radar. Since it has been out since 2003, it’s one of the forerunners in the MMORPG community.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "If you are looking for a MMO with simple controls, then Seal Online is also a title to consider. Almost every action you can do in Seal Online, including movement and most of the combat, is done with point-and-click functionality. The only thing that isn’t is the combo system which adds an extra layer to the combat mechanic using the ASD keys.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "There are over 7 classes you can choose at the start of your adventure within Seal Online. Another cool aspect is if you choose to start with the “beginner” class, an option to switch between the other classes will be available at level 10. Seal Online offers the basic MMORPG elements as well, including guilds, in-game bank accounts to store items and currency, questing systems and the ability to create parties to play with other players.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "One interesting feature in Seal Online is the use of the Combo system. During battle, the user can input combos which appear on the screen once your XP bar reaches a certain level. This allows for complicated yet interactive combat that will keep you focused and interested in combat during your long grinding sessions. Seal Online also prides itself in its whimsical-style graphics that give the game a unique and fun feel.",

      description:
        "Team Fortress 2 is Valve’s iconic class-based free-to-play first-person shooter that’s been described as “the most fun you can have online.” Choose from one of nine classes, each with unique weapons and personalities, split into RED and BLU teams, and engage in crazy combat with a bunch of your closest enemies.The characters in Team Fortress 2 are larger-than-life personalities who grant the game a sense of levity that makes it approachable for players of all skill levels. From the Russian heavy to the inebriated demoman to the military-minded soldier, each character has his own personal flair and specialized weapons. Each character’s main weapon is unique to him and helps define his role on a team. Beyond the basic armament, there are hundreds of additional weapons, created by Valve and by individual users, which have a number of different effects and are balanced by various means. And, of course, there are hats. Many, many hats.Team Fortress 2 has several different game modes, including control point, both with a single point that both teams fight over and multiple points that teams progress along in a line; capture the flag, where players attempt to return a briefcase full of enemy intelligence to their base; attack/defend, where one team tries to push a bomb into the other team’s base; as well as the PvE “Mann vs. Machine” mode, which pits players against wave after wave of robotic versions of their classes.Almost as entertaining as the game itself is Valve’s marketing for the game, which puts the characters’ personalities to the forefront in video shorts and online comic books. They range from introductory videos, such as “Meet the Medic” (and other classes) to story-based films to comics that explore the backstory and history of the Team Fortress 2 game universe. Valve also runs special events around holidays such as Halloween or Christmas, with specially themed levels and items that players can obtain.",

Rappelz shines in many areas, including a large number of classes, a fantastic pet system and a unique Dungeon Siege Mode. Sadly, many of the gameplay mechanics are now dated compared to today’s MMOR’PG selection, and is victim of client issues. If you can look past that, Rappelz offers many amazing features, and it’s always great to revisit MMORPGs that helped set the standard for what the genre is today.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Rappelz’s pet system was one of the first MMORPGs to offer a pet system that provide depth on this level, and even to this day many games don’t go to this extreme with their pet systems. In Rappelz you are able to catch and train virtually every creature that you encounter in the game. Your pets will assist you in fights and will even level up right along with you! In combination with this great feature, Rappelz also has the Dungeon Siege mode. In this mode your guild can take control of dungeons available in the game. By owning a dungeon, your guild obtains different bonuses including a ‘tax’ that forces other players to pay to your guild when they access this dungeon.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "With Rappelz’s very unique and robust features, it set its own place in the history books. One other feature that should be mentioned is the amount of classes available. You can choose from over 30 class types, and your character can be one of the three races in the universe. Not all of the classes can be played from the start. Most of them have to be unlocked by reaching set character and job levels.",

Novus had the unfortunate luck of having a very limited supply of natural resources. Due to this, the three factions on Novus are in constant war with each other for control of these resources. You can join the fight as any of the three factions, with four different classes to choose from. Along with your class, the main portion of character customization stems from your specializations and gear, but the progression you decide to take in your class also alters your character.\r\n" +

Besides headquarters, settlement towns and some portal locations, no area in RF online is safe from other players.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Since the entire world is at constant war with each other over resources, your job is to kill every player from opposing factions that you come in contact with. This PVP element is what makes RF Online fun because of how large-scale the battles become. Another feature within RF Online is the Chip Wars. Chip Wars causes the players to truly feel the importance of the lack of resources, forcing each faction to battle over the Guardian of the mines. These wars only happen three times a day, so gaining control over the “Chips” is important for your factions. Do you have what it takes to join the resource battle in RF Online?",

The free-to-play game features a charming visual aesthetic and an addictive gameplay. Being over 10 years old, Flyff has hit many milestones including being played by over 30 million people. While this is certainly impressive, the game’s community is just not anywhere near the size it was years back.\r\n" +

        "This doesn’t mean that the game is dying as Flyff does offer a very social experience. Once you create a character and enter the cute and fluffy world of Flyff, you’ll quickly find out that you cannot progress much alone. The game makes grouping almost required as everyone uses their classes to benefit the group as a whole. This does make the game a bit more of a “party and grind” experience than many contemporary MMOs, but if you’re used to old school features you’ll feel right at home. You’ll also be leveling for quite some time as players need to pick a job, level to 120 at which point you’ll become a “Master” in that profession, drop to level 60 and push you’re way to cap (a higher cap this time) again…and again…and again.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "At level 20 though you’ll gain the ability to fly and move around the colorful world quite a bit faster. Don’t want to kill monsters for hours? That’s ok since Flyff offers many other things for players to take part in including seeking out votes to become Lord of your server, take part in a guild siege with your guildies, take that same guild into the Clockwork Dungeon to take on serious baddies, get married, raise pets, or even just mentor other players.

One insane feature of Mu Online is the level cap. Normally MMO games have a level cap of 50-100, but Mu Online decided to stray from the pack and make it 400. With 12 years of content and 400 levels to grind through, you will always have something to keep you busy with Mu Online.\r\n" +

Player Killing can be annoying to deal with in some MMO’s that allow it, Mu Online decided to put that into their game as well, but created the Outlaw system. The more you go around killing other players, the higher your Outlaw level becomes. Each level creates various disadvantages that they have to deal with. Also, when a player attacks someone else, they have to kill them within a certain time-limit due to a self-defense system.",

        "Second Life is a free to play 3D online virtual world with a huge reputation, is one of the oldest Online Virtual worlds, and is still running strong even today. Second Life is, as the name suggests, virtually a second life that the player can logged into.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Unlike most games where there is a set “goal” or “end” to work toward, Second Life doesn’t really have a linear story, nor does it follow the normal standard for video games. In Second Life, you start with an avatar that can be customized with a huge database filled with different cosmetic items. From there, you can do virtually anything you want. From Exploring countless zones and player created content, roleplaying with others, to using the game as a platform to socialize with others the way you would in real life, there really is no limit to what you can do in Second Life.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Second Life is filled with user generated content. You can choose to take part in that by creating your own content within Second Life, or just spend your time viewing and enjoying content made by fellow Second Life players. This type of content can be in the form of mini-games, buildings, or various types of sims. Second Life has a currency that creates an economy similar to that of the real world. “Linden Dollars” is the currency in Second life and it can even be traded for real world money, meaning that what you make in Second Life holds actual value, allowing people to make a living in Second Life if they choose to!\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "If you are someone that has hopped on the VR ban wagon, then Second Life is a title you need to check out. It has Oculus Rift support, which is a great way to see exactly what VR is capable of. It also adds another element to Second Life, making the game feel even closer to real life. If you are looking for an escape from your normal life, and have an idea of the perfect life you can’t obtain in the real world, then Second Life is for you!\r\n" +

      description:
        "Entropia Universe is free to play 3D Sci-Fi MMORPG with interesting economic and social features. MindArk’s virtual economy universe is known by many names depending on when you started playing the game and what planet was the key planet at the time. While the game is free-to-play and does have some typical MMORPG elements (combat, questing, looting, etc) the primary difference between Entropia Universe and other games is the linking of a real world currency exchange.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Imagine this: you spend $10 USD to buy some in game currency. You then use that currency and your skills (like sweating monsters) to farm up items of value and triple your total in-game currency. Sounds familiar so far, right? Here’s where Entropia Universe differs though. You can exchange that in-game currency BACK into real world money whenever you want to do so at a fixed conversion rate. This means players can play their game, have some fun, and turn an actual real life profit if they work hard enough.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "This primary economic mechanic had netted Entropia Universe some serious press as players buy and sell actual locations in game for hundreds of thousands of real life dollars. The game has also appeared in the Guinness Book of World Records earning titles multiple times for the most expensive virtual items ever sold.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "In game, players aren’t really limited to classes. If you like combat, go for it. Want to be a surgeon? You can do that too. If you can find a way to earn money doing something, chances are that Entropia Universe will allow you to do it. If you’re looking for a slightly off the beaten path Sci-Fi MMO game and would like to take your chance at making some extra scratch, check out Entropia Universe.\r\n",
