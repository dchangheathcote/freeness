        "The most common game modes are PvP battles that revolve around a series of control points or that task players with destroying enemy vehicles, whether AI-controlled or belonging to other players. Each player brings a squad of up to five vehicles and, when your current vehicle is destroyed, you’ll choose another one to ride back into combat. You can also adjust battle realism, opting for simpler controls with target reticles and other helpful guides, or complete realism, with very few artificial elements in the way of aid. In addition to PvP battles, there are also PvE campaigns and missions you can take on alone or with other players. No matter how you play War Thunder, the action will be easy to find and the battles will have you on the edge of your seat!",

        "World of Tanks is a popular free to play multiplayer role playing team-based shooter game developed by Wargaming.net. World of Tanks is based around the middle of the 20th century, and features huge epic battles with various different game modes such as Standard, Assault, Encounter Battles, and an added bonus of 15 tanks vs 15 enemy tanks gameplay.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The game starts off with quite easy gameplay but eventuates into a more difficult game as you progress, and because a typical game only takes between 5-10 minutes the game can get quite intense as well. Unlike other games in World of Tanks you cannot respawn; so when your tank gets destroyed you tank gets destroy and you have to start a new game before you can play again. You can still watch the battlefield from a spectator but who wants to be a spectator when you can join in with action with a simple click of a button?\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "A different aspect of World of Tanks is that you wait in a queue called a “lobby” and then are launched into a random map, with random enemy players. In World of Tanks depending on your gaming style you start off with a fast lightly armored tank, a middle of the range type of tank, or a slower, more heavily armored tank. The tanks are based on real authentic tanks that were in World War 2. There are approximately 150 tanks from 3 different countries, these being Germany, Russia, and the United States of America.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The tank you choose can be customized by performing various different upgrades, which you can acquire through winning experience and credits you gain by winning battles against other enemy tanks. There are 10 different tiers, with tier 1 being a very weak tank going all the way up to tier 10 tanks which are the most powerful. Just like your tanks in the game your crew has a set of skills which progresses as you move through the different tiers in the game.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "You can own multiple tanks but can only pilot 1 tank in any one game. Depending on what nation you choose will determine what research tree you will advance through to unlock new, more powerful tanks, weapons, and crew members to help your battles against the other enemy tanks. Since World of Tanks initial release there have been numerous updates to improve the difficulty, the visual aspects, new fresh maps, and new tanks and allow more exciting clan features of the game. If you like blowing up tanks, with a quick and intense game style you will simply love this game!",

        "A free-to-play martial arts MMORPG that tasks players with learning combination attacks.",
      description:
        "Blade & Soul is a free-to-play, action combat MMORPG from NCSoft that initially released in 2012 in Korea but finally saw a Western release in January 2016. Blade & Soul is a martial arts inspired MMORPG that tasks players with learning action combat based combination attacks for each class. Currently, there are 7 classes available in the game; Assassin, Blade Master, Destroyer, Force Master, Kung-Fu Master, Summoner, and Blade Dancer. New players will want to research the classes prior to starting a new character since classes fall under various race restrictions when choosing from one of the game’s four currently available races.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Blade & Soul’s most notable feature is perhaps the game’s combat. Skills are learned as you level up and are displayed on hotbars in the traditional MMORPG style, but the actual implementation of those skills differs from most other games in the genre. While you will work with “rotations” in combat, it is perhaps better to think of these rotations in the form of “combinations” as each class will have a plethora of skills that can be combined in succession to perform very well animated combination attacks. These combinations may only be two or three buttons or they could be MUCH longer. Unlike other action combat MMOs though, Blade & Soul isn’t going to spoon   feed you the combinations by hitting one key to trigger the next strike in the combination. Instead, Blade & Soul requires you to actually learn not only the combination itself, but each ability’s timing, and the required position to execute certain parts of the combination (Your hot bar actually can change based on position. i.e. being knocked down may give you access to abilities that cannot be used while standing). Learning these combination, aiming them appropriately, and reacting to incoming attacks are the key to the game’s fast paced and sometimes complex combat. If you liked TERA’s combat, you’ll probably enjoy Blade & Soul’s quite a bit.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Leveling brings the usual grind of story, side, and repeatable quests but the game’s environments change so often and are very well rendered that you won’t get bored by the scenery for quite some time. Transportaion is handled with sprint, glide, and even water walking abilities to speed up any backtracking you may have do. Instant teleports are available by spending in-game currency. Leveling requires completion of quests and along the way players will gain gear that can be upgraded along with your character. Feed equipment that you don’t need to your sword, for example, and you get a sword that levels up as your character does. This primary upgrading mechanic applies to many different gear pieces and keeps players going after loot simply to “feed” their primary equipment.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The addition of a “Soul Shield” allows for extra stat customization provided you can find the pieces of the shield you desire. Skills can be further customized at about level 18 (it’s actually a story completion point that triggers this mechanic) by spending points in your martial tome to increase ability effectiveness.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "If you enjoy dungeons, Blade & Soul has quite a few options for you. Each dungeon (be it a full instance or just a cave on the world map) has numerous difficulty levels and varying party size requirements. This keeps the loot fest rolling as certain dungeons will drop the items needed to “Breakthrough” on your weapon and gear upgrading. The game’s matchmaking system makes finding a party for these runs very easy.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Blade & Soul’s PvP is based on two main categories; World PvP and Arena PvP. Arena PvP is a 1v1 or 3v3/6v6 (currently only in Korea) affair. Versus matches are simply queued for while World PvP is based on what your character is wearing. You read that right. World PvP is based on what you are wearing. It’s a creative way to “flag” for PvP. Simply donning the costume of one of the game’s 2 factions makes you able to be attacked by a member of the opposing faction out in the world. Other costumes could turn normally friendly NPCs into enemy NPCs that will attack you on sight.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Blade & Soul’s cash shop varies by geographic location but for the most part contains the normal consumables, costumes, and cosmetics. However, some materials are also available in the shop. The multiple shops actually utilize multiple currency types and a currency exchange system is in place to provide free players with a means to acquire cash shop items. A subscription service is also available and provides additional perks to players that opt for the payment.",

All characters have the same basic moves, but weapon drops during matches can shake things up. Each fighter has two weapons he or she can pick up, each with distinctive attacks. Some warriors specialize in close-quarters combat, while others prefer to attack at range. Characters have both heavy and light attacks at their disposal, as well as plenty of aerial acrobatics they can perform. Matches end after a time limit, or when a sufficient number of kills have been reached.\r\n" +

        "Each match in Brawlhalla can be fully customized for length, arena, and number of players. Play online with friends or with random opponents. You can compete in casual matches or take your skills to ranked 1v1 arenas by yourself or in 2v2 with a friend to climb up the ranking ladder. Matches can support up to eight players, in 4v4 team battles, or you can practice alone or against bots to master your moves.\r\n" +

        "Brawlhalla is fully free-to-play, with no hidden costs or microtransactions apart from cosmetic changes. Blue Mammoth Games even gives players the option to refund their purchase, a limited number of times, if they’re unhappy with their selection. Whether you’re a hardcore ladder-climber or a button-mashing brawler, it all adds up to one of the most enjoyable games you’ll find online!",

        "Warface is a free-to-play online FPS from Crytek, makers of the Far Cry and Crysis series of games, that utilizes the company’s proprietary CryEngine to provide first-rate graphics and a hard-hitting, fast-paced shooter experience. In the near future, a long-running global recession has brought about countless wars, and it’s up to the players to choose a side and fight for justice or for their own personal enrichment. Choose your class, choose your battleground, and prepare to engage in intense firefights that place as much value on teamwork as on individual skill with your weapon.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "There are four classes in Warface – rifleman, sniper, medic, and engineer – and all have to work together to complete the objective at hand. There are loads of options for modifying your chosen class’s primary and secondary weapons, so no two characters ever play quite the same. In combat, you’ll utilize several traditional and high-intensity moves, such as vaulting over obstacles or sliding to take out the bad guys, and any class might be called upon to help out an ally in need.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Battles in Warface take place all over the world, from the Balkans of Eastern Europe to the crowded city streets of Asia to the oil fields of the Middle East. There is a wide variety of mission types available, in both PvP and co-operative PvE. In PvP missions, players choose one of the two sides in the global war: the U.S. military splinter group Warface or the opportunistic mercenaries of Blackwood. Warface also recently introduced a new Battle Royale mode with a brand new PvP map created especially for the Battle Royale mode.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The PvE mission types run the gamut of gameplay. One type of mission, Cyber Horde, was added during Halloween 2013 and tasks players with escorting a truck through territory that’s infested with cyborg zombies. Other PvE mission types see players searching for a mech in a hostile village or playing through a series of three missions.",

        "SMITE is Hi-Rez Studio’s free-to-play MOBA title where you take on the role of an ancient god in a duel for ultimate dominance over god and man alike. With a thriving competitive scene and active support from its developer, SMITE has carved out an impressive niche in the crowded MOBA market.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Players take on the roles of mythological gods and other legendary cultural icons, such as Zeus, Isis, Kali, or Sun Wukong, the Monkey King. Gods fill the typical roles of mage, warrior, hunter, guardian, or assassin, and they can augment their abilities with items purchased during matches. Each god has a basic attack and four unique abilities, in line with their traditional powers, such as Zeus’ mastery of lightning or Sun Wukong’s transformations.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Unlike other MOBAs and their overhead view, SMITE has an over-the-shoulder, third-person look, which sets it apart visually and offers more strategic options for long-range targeting. There are multiple game modes to SMITE, but the most popular is the traditional MOBA-style five-on-five Conquest mode. In this mode, there are three lanes, protected by towers and phoenixes, with the ultimate goal of taking down the opposing team’s titan in their home base. The other areas of the map contain camps of enemies that players can defeat to earn experience and gold to level up their gods and to buy more and better items. And, of course, killing your opponents doesn’t       hurt, either.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Other game modes in SMITE include Arena, a kind of team deathmatch; Joust, a limited form of Conquest with just one lane; Assault, similar to ARAM modes in other MOBAs; and Siege, a game mode with a special juggernaut that powers through enemy defenses. Finally, SMITE is a major player in the e-sports scene, with its 2016 World Championships drawing millions of viewers and $1 million in prizes.",

        "Warframe is a 3D free-to-play cooperative third-person shooter game set in an stunning sci-fi world. In the distant future, war against the Grineer Empire leads humanity to summon ancient warriors from the distant past. Called “Tenno,” these agile fighters are equally skilled in blades and guns, able to carve their way through scores of enemies with skill and aplomb. A vast arsenal of these human weapons are called upon in mankind’s darkest hour to rescue their brethren from total annihilation.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "As one of these Tenno, staked with protecting humanity, you’ll root out the Grineer from all their hiding places, scouring the Solar System and eliminating this nefarious threat. You’ll choose from among dozens of deadly Warframes, each with its own set of skills and strengths. The game progresses through a series of levels, each themed around a planet or region of the Solar System, and each requiring a squad of four Tenno to clear. As you advance, you’ll unlock more power for your Tenno, including new weapons and skills, letting you take on even tougher enemies.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Tenno have a number of sweet moves at their disposal, including the ability to “parkour” over and around obstacles, ziplines they can balance on, wall-latching and wall-dashing, and more. Tenno are also spiritual warriors, able to channel energy to spectacular results, including augmenting their weapon damage or activating special powers. Even when downed in battle, Tenno can continue to fight and rally to continue their missions.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Between missions, you can purchase better weapons for your Tenno or even entirely new Warframes, so you can try out a different play style. Some items cost credits (in-game currency) while others require platinum, which is purchased with real money. You can also craft your own weapons and insert mods to make them more powerful. Your ship, the Liset, is also where you’ll select your next mission, which you can choose to be public, letting anyone join you, or private, which you can attempt with a pre-selected team.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Warframe requires fast reflexes and split-second timing to execute a Tenno’s most dynamic moves. Because the game demands constant progression, and the resources required to purchase those progressions, a high skill factor is required, not only to play, but to play quickly enough to advance at a reasonable rate – and to keep up with your teammates. As such, there’s a lot of repetition required. If you want to quickly rip through content over and over, growing in power with each iteration, Warframe will suit you.",

There are six classes in the game, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and players can freely swap their characters between those classes to suit their current task. The game also boasts several vehicles, ranging from tanks and armored personnel carriers to futuristic fighter jets and flying troop transports, so you never know just what you’ll be up against. You can fill a role as a driver or pilot, support your allies with healing or ammunition, or just get behind a big gun and blow people away.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Battle across the continents of Auraxis is a base-hopping affair, with each of the three factions striving to control the most territory by attacking enemy bases and defending their own. There are a number of different facilities, requiring coordination from infantry, armor, and air forces to conquer. Sometimes, efficient strategy and tactics win the day, and other times, a simple full-on direct assault will do the trick.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "As you play, you’ll earn certifications you can use to buy new weapons and passive abilities for your characters and your vehicles, or you can buy them with real money.

Building on that first game’s guiding principles, it offers a huge world to explore, populated with dynamic events that can start at any time and provide excellent variety in gameplay.

Each class has remarkable versatility, allowing it to fill a number of roles in a party and reducing the need for a full MMO-style “trinity.” Characters have limited skill bars of 10 slots; the first five are determined by your weapon and the second five by skills that you choose: a healing skill, three utility skills, and an elite skill. Different classes have ways to access other skills, and most classes have the ability to swap out weapons, so you’ll still have some variety in exactly what tools you can bring to each fight.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The heart of Guild Wars 2 is its open-world content. While there is some static content, in the form of “hearts” that you can complete once for NPCs, most of the game revolves around dynamic events, which spring up in the world at various times and often require large groups of players to complete. There are no traditional quests that require you to speak to NPCs to accept or complete them; instead, you can simply go from event to event, helping the people of Tyria as you see fit. Some events are parts of larger chains that string together and culminate in a giant event against a great threat to Tyria and require a hundred or more players to complete.",

        "Runescape, is a popular free to play 3D browser based fantasy MMORPG boasting a huge player base and a massive world with 15 years of content. Developed by Jagex, the game does not require players to choose a specific class. Subsequently, you are not limited in terms of what kind of hero you want to play. The browser MMORPG features 26 distinct skills for players to level. Players do not allocate points to upgrade certain skills. Rather, their abilities are enhanced by performing certain actions like mining ore, casting spells of fishing.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "The world of Gelinor is divided into various kingdoms, regions and cities. Each regions features different loot, monsters and quests to complete. You explore this vast world via a customizable avatar. The game allows you to interact with other players in various different ways including the in-game chat system, combat and mini-games that are either competitive or collaborative.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Due to the randomized elements in the Runescape’s dungeons, gameplay remains engaging rather than repetitive. You can choose to brave the world of Gelinor alone, or collaborate with other players to take down especially challenging bosses. Should you so choose, you can also engage in PvP combat. While it does not follow a linear story, the game contains myriad quests and deep, immersive narrative to keep players engaged.\r\n" +
        "\r\n" +
        "Released in 2001, the game is consistently updated to add new content, new features and various special events. The third iteration of the game, known as RuneScape 3 (RS3), is an enhanced version of the RuneScape HD update. This major upgrade was launched on Monday July 22nd 2013, bringing even more features such as a new engine, customisable interfaces and new content. But if you’re a RuneScape veteran looking for the original version, the Old School RuneScape is still available.",
